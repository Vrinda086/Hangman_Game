# Hangman_Game
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game. <br/>
In this Hangman Game project the player chooses a category and a random word is selected from the category and the player has to guess the word in limited number of attempts.
##
## Concepts Used
The key concepts used are: <br/>
 **1.Strings:** In the game they are used to store the hidden word, handle user input /letters guessed, and compare guessed letters with the hidden word. <br>
 **2.Conditional Statements:** Used to determine if a guessed letter is correct or incorrect and managing the visual representation of Hangman based on the number of incorrect guesses. <br>
 **3.Functions:** Used to separate different parts of the game logic. <br>
 **4.Randomization:** Used to choose a random word from predefined categories to provide variety. <br>
 **5.Error Handling:**  Handles invalid input (e.g., non-alphabetic characters, repeated guesses) to ensure smooth execution of the game.
